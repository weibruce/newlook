/**
 * Permission entity. Generally permission is string based.
 * <p>
 * Since this security is based on Apache Shiro, the default shiro permission
 * string format like "user:create" is used. More details please refer:
 * http://shiro.apache.org/permissions.html
 * <p>
 * For simple and clean, multi-parts permission definition is not recommended
 * and should not used in product development. So "user:view, update" is
 * disallowed but define two string permission "user:view" and "user:update" to
 * get 2 permissions. Multi-parts permission has parsed issue in Shiro v1.2.1,
 * again,avoid using it for now.
 * <p>
 * Shiro WildcardPermission is used by default. If individual system wants to
 * define its own permission format, it's also very low effort to do that - just
 * define itw own permission and permission resolver that inject the Shiro
 * SecurityManager. More details about custom permission please refer:
 *
 * @see org.apache.shiro.authz.permission.WildcardPermission
 * @see org.apache.shiro.authz.permission.WildcardPermissionResolver
